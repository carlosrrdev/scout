# scout

A somewhat niche directory &amp; file crawler

## Description

**scout** is, quiet simply, a directory and file crawler. You provide a parent directory and scout will go through and 
craw each subdirectory and file and capture the full path for each. The paths are then stored in a local sqlite file.
Now you can use the search field to quickly search for any directory or path and open them with a single click.

## Goal

To provide a quick and *fast* way to search through a large directory of subdirectories and files and provide a way to 
quickly open any subdirectory or file.

## Disclaimer

This project was created purely for my own personal use at my current job. I needed a quick way to search and find
directories and files and I found the native OS file search to be too slow and cumbersome.
